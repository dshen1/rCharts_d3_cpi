A mutual fund presented yesterday, and it seemed like I was in 2003-2006 all over again as they discussed the inflationary tinder and told anecdotes about avocado prices and other foods, referenced Friedman quotes, and reminisced about boyhood in the inflationary 70s.


I went back to my desk and immediately tried to fire up my [old Shiny/d3 CPI graphs](http://glimmer.rstudio.com/timelyportfolio/d3-shiny-cpi/).  Unfortunately though I got an error, since the [BLS changed from ftp to http](http://www.bls.gov/bls/discontinuation_ftp.htm) on March 1, 2014.  Intead of fixing the old, I completely rewrote the chart with [rCharts](http://rcharts.io) and [d3.js](http://d3js.org) again using [this nice example](http://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/4053096) from [@syntagmatic](https://twitter.com/syntagmatic).  **This still needs work.**  The multiple series with same name are from the different [BLS areas](http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.htm#Question_17).  I'll try to make that into a separate Angular filter.


When someone starts talking about abstruse food prices, use this handy CPI component graph, or quandl offers some difficult to find [food prices]() with a [great API](http://www.quandl.com/help/api) and even [packages for almost every language and Excel](http://www.quandl.com/help/packages).


### Question in My Mind
If "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output" ([Friedman 1970](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman)) then **what is deflation?**


```{r echo = F, eval = F}
#here are the two data source, but really don't need to do this in R
#could easily supply the locations as data instead
#and use d3.tsv
#but might generate the filters in R just to show combo

#put items in data frame
items.df <- read.delim(
  "http://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ap/ap.item"
  , allowEscapes=TRUE
  , header=TRUE
  , stringsAsFactors=FALSE
  , strip.white=TRUE
)[,-2,drop=F]
items.df[,1] <- gsub(x=items.df[,1],pattern='\\"',replacement="")
items.df$item_name <- items.df$item_code
items.df$item_code <- rownames(items.df)

#get series data
series.df <- read.delim(
  "http://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ap/ap.series"
  , allowEscapes=TRUE
  , header=TRUE
  , stringsAsFactors=FALSE
  , strip.white=TRUE
)

#join items and series
require(dplyr)
items.joined <- items.df %.%
  left_join(series.df, by = "item_code")

#actually changed this to a saved tsv so r would not have to pass large data set
#load the average price file which is large
#prices.df <- read.delim(
#  "http://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ap/ap.data.0.Current"
#  , allowEscapes=TRUE
#  , header=TRUE
#  , stringsAsFactors=FALSE
#  , strip.white=TRUE
#)
```
